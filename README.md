# Predicting housing prices using regression techniques

My attempt at a beginner Kaggle compeition to apply techniques I've learned from Udacity's MLND course. 

**Goal**
Build supervised learner with given training and testing set to predict sales price of each unit. The label to predict is the `SalePrice`. 

**Metric**
Prediction is evaluated by the Root-Mean-Squared-Error.
