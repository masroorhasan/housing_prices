# Predicting from Ames housing dataset using regression techniques

My attempt at a beginner Kaggle compeition to apply techniques I've learned from Udacity's MLND course.

**Goal**
Build supervised regressor with given training set to predict sales price of each unit in testing set. The label to predict is the `SalePrice`.

**Metric**
Prediction is evaluated by the R2 and Root-Mean-Squared-Error. 

**Refs**
Dataset provided by [Ames Housing dataset](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education.
